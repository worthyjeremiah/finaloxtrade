            <h2>Refund Policy:</h2>
            <p>
            Once we officially confirm your payment for the evaluation plan, we will email you the login details to access your evaluation. After you receive this information, we cannot issue a refund.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, we understand that in certain cases, you may need a refund. If you notify us early and there are no trades placed on your account within the first 14 days, we may work with you to provide a refund. For assistance with this type of scenario, please contact our live support.
            </p>
            <h2>Dispute Policy:</h2>
            <p>
            Clients who improperly dispute charges will face legal action and will be banned from our platform. Chargeback fraud is a significant issue in the prop firm industry. Any traders who commit fraud through faulty chargebacks will have their names shared with other prop firms in the industry to ensure that bad actors do not have a lasting effect on prop firms.
            </p>
            <h2>Refunds After Successful Completion of the Evaluation:</h2>
            <p>
            We offer both a 1-Step and 2-Step program. For our 1-Step program, we do not offer refunds of the challenge fee. Traders are rewarded based solely on their performance during the funded stage. For our 2-Step program, we also do not offer any refunds.
            </p>
            <h2>Acceptance of This Policy:</h2>
            <p>
            It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with this refund policy. By placing an order for any of our challenges, you indicate that you have read this refund policy and fully accept its terms.
