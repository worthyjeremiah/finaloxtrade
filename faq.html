                  We strongly emphasize the importance of using a stop loss in trading. Our statistical data has consistently shown that traders who do not implement a stop loss face higher risks and are less likely to succeed in the long term. Therefore, we have implemented a requirement for all trades to have a stop loss in place within the MT5 Terminal.

<br>
It is crucial to note that trades closed without a stop loss will be flagged as violations by our risk management system. These trades will not be counted towards your target. Additionally, any profits generated from trades closed without a stop loss will not be eligible for consideration.

<br>
By adhering to our stop loss requirement, you can enhance your risk management practices and increase your chances of success in trading.

                  The main rules you need to be aware of that can get you disqualified immediately are (1) The Maximum Loss and (2) The Max Daily Loss. We have an automated system that will close all your open trades and freeze your account immediately once one of the rules above is breached.

            <div class="sub-question">
              <p>How is the Max Daily Drawdown "MDD" calculated?</p>
              <div class="sub-question-toggle"></div>
              <div class="sub-question-answer">
                <p>On any given day, it is important to adhere to our maximum daily drawdown rule, which states that the loss must not equal or exceed 4% of the initial account balance.</p>
<p>The formula to calculate the maximum daily drawdown (MDD) is as follows: MDD = 4% x Initial Account Balance. Additionally, the daily stop-out level (DSL) is determined by subtracting the maximum daily drawdown from the start of day account balance.</p>
<p>Please note that the maximum daily drawdown includes swaps, commissions, and spreads. The MDD resets every day at Midnight Broker's Time.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example to better understand how this rule works: Suppose you start with a $50,000 challenge and an initial account balance of $50,000. On day 3, your account balance reaches $54,000.</p>
<p>On that same day:</p>
<p>Your maximum daily drawdown (MDD) would be $50,000 x 4% = $2,000. Your daily stop-out level (DSL) would be $54,000 - $2,000 = $52,000.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore a few scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong></p>
<p>If your daily starting account balance is $54,000 and you incur a loss of $1,000 earlier in the day, you will still have room to lose the remaining $1,000 by midnight broker's time. You would be stopped out when your account balance (including any open trades) reaches $52,000. The next day, the MDD would reset and be calculated based on the new day's starting account balance.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose your starting account balance is $54,000, and you earn a net profit of $3,000 earlier in the day. The maximum daily stop-out level remains $52,000 since it is based on the daily starting account balance. In this case, you can afford to lose $5,000, which is the $3,000 profit you made earlier plus the $2,000 maximum daily drawdown. Your account would only be terminated if you reach $52,000 due to breaching the maximum daily drawdown.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #3:</strong></p>
<p>Consider a scenario where your starting account balance is $54,000, and you make a net profit of $3,000 earlier in the day. However, you have open trades with total floating losses of $4,500. The maximum daily stop-out level remains $52,000. In this case, you need to monitor your floating losses. You won't violate the maximum daily drawdown rule on the same day since your total loss for the day is only $1,500 ($3,000 closed net profit - $4,500 floating losses), which is below the maximum daily drawdown of $2,000. However, if you leave those positions open until the next day (after midnight broker's time), breaching the maximum daily drawdown rule would occur since you would end up with $4,500, exceeding the $2,000 maximum daily drawdown limit.</p>
<p>It is crucial to manage risk effectively and ensure you do not surpass the maximum daily drawdown limit to avoid account termination.</p>

            <div class="sub-question">
              <p>How is the Maximum Loss calculated?</p>
              <div class="sub-question-toggle"></div>
              <div class="sub-question-answer">
                <p>The "Maximum Loss" refers to a fixed USD amount that you may experience on any given day, calculated from the initial account balance.</p>
<p>In our platform, the Maximum Loss is set at 6% of the Initial Account Balance.</p>
<p>The formula to calculate the Maximum Loss is as follows: Maximum Loss = 6% x Initial Account Balance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stop-out level (SL) is determined by subtracting the Maximum Loss from the initial account balance. For instance, if your initial account balance is $50,000, your stop-out level would be $50,000 - ($50,000 x 6%) = $47,000.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the Maximum Loss is intended to limit your losses to a specific fixed amount, which is a percentage of your initial account balance. In this case, your losses should not exceed 6% of your initial account balance.</p>

              <p>How is the Max Daily Drawdown "MDD" calculated?</p>
              <div class="sub-question-toggle"></div>
              <div class="sub-question-answer">
                <p>On any given day, it is important to adhere to our maximum daily drawdown rule, which states that the loss must not equal or exceed 5% of the initial account balance.</p>
<p>The formula to calculate the maximum daily drawdown (MDD) is as follows: MDD = 5% x Initial Account Balance.</p>
<p>Additionally, the daily stop-out level (DSL) is determined by subtracting the maximum daily drawdown from the start of day account balance.</p>
<p>Please note that the maximum daily drawdown includes swaps, commissions, and spreads. The MDD resets every day at Midnight Broker's Time.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example to better understand how this rule works:</p>
<p>Suppose you start with a $50,000 challenge and an initial account balance of $50,000. On day 3, your account balance reaches $54,000.</p>
<p>On that same day:</p>
<p>Your maximum daily drawdown (MDD) would be $50,000 x 5% = $2,500.</p>
<p>Your daily stop-out level (DSL) would be $54,000 - $2,500 = $51,500.</p>
<p>Now, let's explore a few scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong></p>
<p>If your daily starting account balance is $54,000 and you incur a loss of $1,000 earlier in the day, you will still have room to lose the remaining $1,000 by midnight broker's time. You would be stopped out when your account balance (including any open trades) reaches $51,500. The next day, the MDD would reset and be calculated based on the new day's starting account balance.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose your starting account balance is $54,000, and you earn a net profit of $3,000 earlier in the day. The maximum daily stopout level remains $51,500 since it is based on the daily starting account balance. In this case, you can afford to lose $5,000, which is the $3,000 profit you made earlier plus the $2,500 maximum daily drawdown. Your account would only be terminated if you reach $51,500 due to breaching the maximum daily drawdown.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #3:</strong></p>
<p>Consider a scenario where your starting account balance is $54,000, and you make a net profit of $3,000 earlier in the day. However, you have open trades with total floating losses of $4,500. The maximum daily stopout level remains $51,500. In this case, you need to monitor your floating losses. You won't violate the maximum daily drawdown rule on the same day since your total loss for the day is only $1,500 ($3,000 closed net profit - $4,500 floating losses), which is below the maximum daily drawdown of $2,500. However, if you leave those positions open until the next day (after midnight broker's time), breaching the maximum daily drawdown rule would occur since you would end up with $4,500, exceeding the $2,500 maximum daily drawdown limit.</p>
<p>It is crucial to manage risk effectively and ensure you do not surpass the maximum daily drawdown limit to avoid account termination.</p>

              <p>How is the Maximum Loss calculated?</p>
              <div class="sub-question-toggle"></div>
              <div class="sub-question-answer">
                <p>The "Maximum Loss" refers to a fixed USD amount that you may experience on any given day, calculated from the initial account balance.</p>
<p>In our platform, the Maximum Loss is set at 10% of the Initial Account Balance.</p>
<p>The formula to calculate the Maximum Loss is as follows: Maximum Loss = 10% x Initial Account Balance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stop-out level (SL) is determined by subtracting the Maximum Loss from the initial account balance.</p>
<p>For instance, if your initial account balance is $50,000, your stop-out level would be $50,000 - ($50,000 x 10%) = $45,000.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the Maximum Loss is intended to limit your losses to a specific fixed amount, which is a percentage of your initial account balance. In this case, your losses should not exceed 10% of your initial account balance.</p>

                  It is crucial to note that trades closed without a stop loss will be flagged as violations by our risk management system. These trades will not be counted towards your target.

It is important to adhere to our funding terms and conditions, which require the use of a stop loss. Not using a stop loss violates these terms.</p>
<p>At the end of each phase, it is necessary to review the account status. To initiate the review process, please ensure that all market and pending orders are closed once the Profit Target is reached.
